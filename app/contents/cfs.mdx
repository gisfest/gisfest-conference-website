	content={`GISfest 2023 is a conference that unites geospatial experts and enthusiasts from Africa and beyond for insightful discussions on the applications of geospatial technologies across various industries. This year's event aims to shine a prominent light on Geoinnovation and its pivotal role in shaping Africa's future. Our goal for GISfest is to curate a diverse range of trending topics that highlight the transformative power of innovation in shaping people, patterns, processes, and places (4Ps) throughout the African continent. By doing so, we aim to inspire participants to gather ideas for their own unique use-cases and potentially identify untapped opportunities to create new business or social solutions.This two-day physical event will include workshops, presentations, panel discussions, as well as opportunities to connect with community members from across Africa.`}

<Heading content="B. Workshop" />

<ParaGraph
	content={`Technical deep dive into tool and techniques implementation. We are looking for a workshop focused on any of the following tracks:
`}
>

- **Geodev utilizing WebGIS / Python / JavaScript etc.**

As our spatially enabled society grows, so does the need to create functional
and usable webmaps, visualizations and expand coding capabilities. The
geospatial development workshop is designed to teach and expose conference
participants to different techniques for geospatial development by utilizing
different tools such as Python, JavaScript etc.

- **Spatial Analytics – Methodologies such as ML / UAV data processing etc.**

Spatial Analytics remains the backbone of all decision-making. In order to
fully reach an appropriate conclusion, we utilize location as the connective
thread to uncover hidden patterns, improve predictive modeling, and create a
competitive edge. For the Spatial Analytics section, participants will get
to interact with case studies that evoke critical spatial cognition thinking
to create appropriate geo visualization that is backed by solid
geostatistical theory.

- **Geo AI / data Science – Machine learning, Deep learning etc.**

The science and technology of Geo AI/data science have come a long way.
Today’s executives are thinking about areas including market planning, site
selection, product selection, price optimization, where they want to use Geo
AI to better anticipate outcomes for their business and make better
decisions based on these insights. For the Geo AI session, participants will
get to learn different Geo AI techniques and tools that can be useful to
them as an individual or corporate entity.

- **Cloud Computing – GEE / Cloud platform etc.**

With the growth of data in every sphere of our life. Data can be mined and
stored by virtually all sensors around us making the amount of data for
processing too much to handle by a standalone computer. To mitigate these
issues and provide scalability, cloud computing has become an on-demand tool
for data storage and processing. In the geospatial industry, this comes as a
collection of geospatial datasets and satellite imageries with on-the-go
scale analysis tools. In this section, participants will get to learn,
interact and utilise the most popular cloud computing platforms and
resources.
